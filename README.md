# Instacart Data Analysis Case Study
The following project is an assignment from CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course. I completed the project independently. Open-source data sets from Instacart provide the order and product data. The customer data are fictional.

## Overview and Purpose
Instacart is interesting in discovering more about their sales patterns. I perform analyses to inform strategy suggestions for better segmentation based on provided criteria.

## Context
The end goal for Instacart is a targeted marketing strategy. They need someone adept in Python's pandas library to analyze over 32 million rows of data.

See the orders and products data dictionaries [here](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b). 
This data dictionary does not belong to me, and was provided to me by CareerFoundry.

The raw data is too large for the repository. See the population flow [here](/02%20Data/population-flow.pdf).


## Objective
•	The sales team needs to know the days and times with the most orders.

•	They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money. 

•	The marketing and sales teams want simpler price range groupings.

•	The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
